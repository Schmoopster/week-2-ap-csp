# # Step 1: Create Variables
# # TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Lorenzo"
age = 15
favorite_color = "Purple"
favorite_number = 11

# #  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# # 1. Print your name in uppercase
print(first_name.upper())

# # 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name))

# # 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print("My name is", (first_name), "and my favorite color is", (favorite_color.lower()))

# #  Step 3: Math Practice
# # Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
num1 = 3
num2 = 3
num3 = input("what is your 3rd fav number")
num4 = input("what is your 4th fav number")
print(num1 + num2)
print(num3 + num4)
# #  Step 4: User Input Practice
# # Ask the user two questions and combine answers
num5 = input("what condiment is yellow and comes from seeds and is put on hotdogs?")
num6 = input("What number comes after 66?")
print(num5 + num6)

# # ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# # Use math and strings together
